# Chess AI Implementation Project

![Chess Board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zaphodgjd/class-chess-123/main/chess/w_king.png)

## 🎯 Project Overview
This repository contains a skeleton implementation of a Chess AI engine written in C++. The project is designed to teach fundamental concepts of game AI, including board representation, move generation, and basic game tree search algorithms. 

The entire chess movement part has been reworked.

there's a new function called canBitMoveFromTo(), and most of the moves' legalities are determined within that single function. 

the chess pieces' movements are somewhat hardcoded, rook, knight, and king's movements have a specific array assigned to them therefore they can only move within those coordinates. Queen uses a combination of rook and bishop's movement. The BitHolder file was also modified to fit into the need to operate Chess.cpp, adding 2 more variables within the initHolder function: row and column.

If you take a look at the code, you'll find the code very messy. A lot of if/else cases and switch cases with a lot of boolean variables. As I could not think of a better way to implement those legality checks with the time we have this quarter. 

Moving onto the FEN strings, I've used a while loop to loop through the entire FEN string, creating a character variable and compare the characters with the ones in the string. The switch cases are operated based on the FEN string detection. 

En Passant was was challenging since we have to find out if the opponent has made a double push move using the pawns. And check that if the piece will successfully being removed just like a normal capture.

Castling was done with 4 boolean variables. 2 for the King/Queen on black, 2 for the King/Queen on white. They are true for the opening position.



### 🎓 Educational Purpose
This project serves as a teaching tool for computer science students to understand:
- Game state representation
- Object-oriented design in C++
- Basic AI concepts in game playing
- Bitboard operations and chess piece movement
- FEN (Forsyth–Edwards Notation) for chess position representation

## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Key Components
1. **Chess Class**: Core game logic implementation
   - Board state management
   - Move validation
   - Game state evaluation
   - AI player implementation

2. **Piece Representation**
   - Unique identifiers for each piece type
   - Sprite loading and rendering
   - Movement pattern definitions

3. **Board Management**
   - 8x8 grid representation
   - Piece positioning
   - Move history tracking
   - FEN notation support

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler with C++11 support or higher
- Image loading library for piece sprites
- CMake 3.10 or higher

### Building the Project
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Running Tests
```bash
./chess_tests
```

## 📝 Implementation Details

### Current Features

## 🔍 Code Examples

### Piece Movement Validation
```cpp
bool Chess::canBitMoveFromTo(Bit& bit, BitHolder& src, BitHolder& dst) {
    // TODO: Implement piece-specific movement rules
    return false;
}
```

### FEN Notation Generation
```cpp
const char Chess::bitToPieceNotation(int row, int column) const {
    if (row < 0 || row >= 8 || column < 0 || column >= 8) {
        return '0';
    }
    // Implementation details for FEN notation
}
```
